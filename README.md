# CLNX
[The official repository](https://github.com/CodeLinguaNexus-CLNX/codelinguanexus-clnx.github.io/tree/main) of CodeLinguaNexus "CLNX: Bridging Code and Natural Language for Advanced Vulnerability Detection in C/C++"

## Introduction
**Program Data:** stores the original Deivgn Dataset used in our paper and the Comments Dataset we construct.

**Implementation:** stores the step by step operations of CLNX's structure-level naturalization and token-level naturalization.

**Model:** stores the “bin” file of CLNX-CodeBERT fine-tuned on the given datasets. Besides, this directory stores the scripts provided by [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection/code), which are used to fine-tune and evaluate model on specific datasets, including 'run.py' and 'model.py'.
