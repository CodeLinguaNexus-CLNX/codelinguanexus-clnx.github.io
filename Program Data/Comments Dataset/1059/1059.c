/*
This function is responsible for verifying the checksum of the data in the ByteIOContext.

Here's the detail:
The function first calls the get_checksum function to obtain the checksum value from the ByteIOContext. It then compares this checksum value with the value obtained by calling the get_be32 function on the ByteIOContext. The current implementation seems to log the checksum and the obtained value in the error log using the av_log function, but the comparison result is not used for the return value.

In the provided code, the comparison result is discarded, and the function always returns 0, effectively indicating that the checksum check always fails.

Need's to notice:
- The current implementation does not return a meaningful result based on the checksum comparison, and it may be intended for debugging or testing purposes.
- If the intention is to perform a checksum verification, the comparison result should be used to determine the validity of the checksum and return an appropriate value.
- It's important to ensure that the get_checksum and get_be32 functions are correctly implemented and return the expected values for proper checksum verification.
- The use of logging for checksum values and comparison results suggests that this function may be intended for diagnostic purposes, and its behavior may need to be revised for actual validation of the checksum.
