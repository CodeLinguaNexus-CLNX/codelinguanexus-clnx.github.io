/*
This function is responsible for initializing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) context with the specified number of bits and the transformation direction (inverse or forward).

Here's the detail: The function allocates memory for the FFTContext structure using av_malloc. It then checks if the memory allocation was successful and initializes the FFT context using the ff_fft_init function. If the initialization fails, it frees the allocated memory using av_freep. Finally, it returns a pointer to the initialized FFTContext structure.

Need's to notice: When using this function, it's important to handle the return value appropriately to account for the possibility of a NULL pointer if initialization fails. Additionally, ensure that the memory allocated for the FFTContext structure is properly released after its use to prevent memory leaks. Lastly, validate the inputs (nbits and inverse) before calling this function to prevent potential issues related to incorrect parameter values.
