/*
This function is responsible for reading packets from an IPMVE (IP Movie Encoder) format within the context of an FFmpeg application or library.

Here's the detail:
- It first initializes the IP Movie context and the Byte IO context.
- Then it calls the `process_ipmovie_chunk` function to process the IPMVE chunks and populate the AVPacket `pkt`.
- Depending on the return value of `process_ipmovie_chunk`, appropriate error codes are assigned to `ret`.
- The function then returns the final value of `ret`, which indicates the result of the packet reading operation.

Needs to notice:
- The function assumes that the input `AVFormatContext` and `AVPacket` are properly initialized and are valid for reading packets.
- It is important to handle the potential error codes returned by the `process_ipmovie_chunk` function appropriately, as per the defined error handling strategy in the calling code.
- Any specific memory management or resource handling related to the `IPMVEContext` structure and the associated `ByteIOContext` should be managed outside of this function to prevent memory leaks or resource conflicts.
