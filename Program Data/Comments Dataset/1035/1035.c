/*
This function is responsible for handling samples in a null filter, which essentially means discarding or ignoring the samples that pass through the filter.

Here's the detail:
The function takes an AVFilterLink pointer 'link' and an AVFilterBufferRef pointer 'samplesref' as input. The 'link' parameter refers to the input link of the null filter, while 'samplesref' represents the reference to the samples buffer to be processed. In this implementation, the function simply returns 0, indicating that the samples are effectively ignored or discarded. This means that the null filter does not perform any processing on the samples and allows them to pass through unchanged.

Need's to notice:
- This function serves as a placeholder for potential future functionality. While it currently discards the samples, it can be extended to implement customized processing logic as per the requirements of the filter.
- When modifying this function, it's important to consider the overall data flow and processing pipeline to ensure that any changes do not disrupt the intended behavior of the null filter within the larger filter graph.
- Depending on the specific use case, additional handling or logging of the discarded samples may be necessary for debugging or monitoring purposes.
