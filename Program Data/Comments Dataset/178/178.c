/*
This function is responsible for returning a constant value of 1 when called.

Here's the detail:
The function 'qemu_cpu_self' takes a void pointer 'env' as an argument, but it does not seem to use this argument for its logic. It simply returns the value 1 when called, without performing any other operations.

Need's to notice:
It's important to note that this function appears to serve a specific purpose, likely as a placeholder or for testing purposes. In a real-world scenario, it would be expected to contain logic related to the CPU environment in order to serve a meaningful purpose. It's also important to verify if the void pointer 'env' is intended to be used in the function's logic or if it can be removed if unnecessary.
