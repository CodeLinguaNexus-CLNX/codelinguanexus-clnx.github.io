/*
This function is responsible for initializing a device object by setting its properties and default values, and adding necessary properties for hotplug support.

Here's the detail of the function:
- Upon initialization, the function first checks if qdev_hotplug is enabled. If so, it sets the 'hotplugged' flag of the device to 1 and updates the global variable qdev_hot_added to true, indicating that a hotplugged device has been added.
- It initializes the 'instance_id_alias' of the device to -1, and sets the 'state' to DEV_STATE_CREATED, indicating that the device is in the created state.
- The function then proceeds to set default values for the device's properties by calling qdev_prop_set_defaults and supplying the device's property list obtained through qdev_get_props.
- It iterates through each property in the device's property list using a for loop, and for each property, it adds a legacy property using qdev_property_add_legacy and a static property using qdev_property_add_static to the device. This is likely to ensure backward compatibility and to provide a static interface for accessing and modifying device properties.
- Finally, the function adds a string property "type" to the device object, using object_property_add_str, to display the device type by calling qdev_get_type.

Needs to notice:
- Understanding the usage and impact of hotplug support is important for configuring the device initialization process as per the hotplug requirements.
- Care should be taken to ensure that default values are appropriately set for the device properties to ensure correct behavior.
- Proper handling and addition of properties, including legacy and static properties, are crucial for providing a consistent and coherent interface for accessing and modifying device properties.
