/*
This function is responsible for finalizing the checksum calculation for network packets, specifically for a 16-bit one's complement checksum.

Here's the detail: The function takes a 32-bit sum as input and iteratively adds the carry (the bits that are shifted out of the 16-bit boundary) back to the sum until the carry is zero. It then returns the one's complement of the resulting sum as the final checksum value.

Need's to notice that the generated token in the comments should not exceed 256 characters in length.
