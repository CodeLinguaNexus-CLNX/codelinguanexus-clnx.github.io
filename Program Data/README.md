To evaluate our research questions using real-world data, We construct our experimental datasets based on the publicly released version of the [Devign Datasets](https://sites.google.com/view/devign).
Besides, We split the Datasets according to [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection).
