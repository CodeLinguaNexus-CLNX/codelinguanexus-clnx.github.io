/*
This function is responsible for decoding and processing the PLTE (palette) chunk in a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image within the context of an AVCodecContext and PNGDecContext.

Here's the detail:
1. The decode_plte_chunk function validates the length of the PLTE chunk to ensure it is a multiple of 3 and does not exceed the maximum limit of 256 * 3, indicating the presence of RGB color components for the palette entries.
2. It then reads the palette entries from the input stream, where each entry consists of three bytes representing the red (r), green (g), and blue (b) color components, and stores the combined color value in the palette array within the PNGDecContext.
3. If the PLTE chunk contains less than 256 palette entries, the function fills the remaining entries with opaque color values (0xFFU << 24) to ensure a consistent palette representation.
4. The function updates the state of the PNG decoder context to indicate the presence of the PLTE chunk, and skips past the 4-byte cyclic redundancy check (crc) field in the input stream.
5. Upon successful processing, the function returns 0 to indicate that the PLTE chunk decoding was completed without errors.

Need's to notice:
1. This function is responsible for handling the PLTE chunk decoding process in the PNG image format, and any modifications to the palette handling or PLTE chunk processing should be carefully validated to maintain compatibility with the PNG specification and decoder behavior.
2. The function assumes that the input stream contains a valid PNG image, and error handling for malformed or inconsistent PLTE chunks is essential to prevent unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
3. When processing the PLTE chunk, it's important to consider the color space and palette representation required by the specific use case or output format of the PNG image, ensuring accurate color reproduction.
4. It's crucial to handle potential edge cases, such as handling incomplete or missing PLTE chunks, to maintain robustness and error resilience in the PNG decoding process.
5. This function is an integral part of the PNG decoding workflow and plays a critical role in processing palette information for subsequent image rendering or display, and any changes should be thoroughly tested to ensure correct behavior across different PNG images and color palettes.
