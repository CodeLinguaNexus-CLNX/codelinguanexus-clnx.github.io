/*
This function is responsible for finalizing resources associated with audio processing in a QPA (Quick Player Application) module. It provides a cleanup mechanism for releasing audio-related resources and performing necessary shutdown procedures.

Here's the detail:
1. The function qpa_audio_fini takes a void pointer opaque as its parameter, which is not used within the function body.
2. It serves as a callback or finalization routine that is invoked when audio processing within the QPA module needs to be shut down or cleaned up.
3. While the function body appears empty, it can be utilized to release resources such as open audio streams, deallocate memory, close devices, or perform any other required cleanup specific to the audio processing functionality.

Need's to notice:
1. Despite the empty body of the function, it serves as a placeholder for potential future cleanup operations related to audio processing in the QPA module.
2. The use of (void) opaque; is a common practice to explicitly indicate that the parameter is intentionally unused and to prevent compiler warnings about unused variables.
3. It may be necessary to update the function body to include relevant cleanup actions as per the requirements of the audio processing module within the QPA.
4. When modifying this function, ensure that any associated audio resources are properly released and any cleanup actions are performed accurately to avoid resource leaks or undefined behavior during shutdown.
