/*
This test function is responsible for testing the functionality of the 'qint_get_int' method, which is used to retrieve the integer value stored in a QInt object and compare it with an expected value.

Here's the detail:
1. The 'qint_get_int_test' function initializes a QInt object with a specific integer value using the 'qint_from_int' method and then retrieves the value using the 'qint_get_int' method. It subsequently compares the retrieved value with the expected value to ensure correctness.

2. The test is designed to validate that the 'qint_get_int' method accurately returns the integer value previously set in the QInt object, allowing for reliable retrieval and comparison of integer values.

3. By utilizing the 'fail_unless' macro, the test asserts that the retrieved integer value matches the expected value, providing a pass/fail indication for the correctness of the 'qint_get_int' method.

Need's to notice:
It's important to ensure that the QInt object is correctly initialized with the expected integer value before calling 'qint_get_int' to guarantee accurate testing. The comparison should be performed with appropriate consideration for integer equality, handling both signed and unsigned integer values as necessary. Additionally, the test should be updated to include boundary and edge cases to comprehensively validate the behavior of the 'qint_get_int' method across various scenarios. Any preconditions required for the proper functioning of 'qint_get_int' should be explicitly met and tested to ensure the reliability of the method under different conditions.
